Python: import module Tkinter
Need to import all modules from Tkinter;
from tkinter import * # Python 3.0 or higher; Tkinter for lower than 3.0

"Start the root"
main = Tk() # uppercase T in Python 3.0 or higher

"Set the parameters for the root/window"
main.title("My GUI")     # title of window
main.geometry("400x500") # size of window

"Kickstart the loop" - everything goes above this point
main.mainloop() # tells Python to keep the window open

Labels, buttons, frames, etc. (objects) are called widgets in Python.
To add widgets, know this bit of code:
.grid(row = [number], column = [number], sticky = W)
sticky indicates which way to put the widget - W for West, on the left

Adding a label:
Label(main, text="This is my GUI").grid(row=0, column=0, sticky=W)

Adding a button:
Button(main, text="My Button", width=6, command=speak).grid(row=1, column=0, sticky=W)
speak is linked to a subroutine - a function.
These subroutines must be defined before the instantiation of main.

def speak():
    print("Hi") # prints Hi to the console, not the window

pass is a keyword to simply do nothing in the command. 

A frame is something that groups widgets together in the GUI - it 
delineates segments within the window with their own rows and columns

Adding a frame:
GUIFrame = Frame(main) # assigning a frame to a variable
GUIFrame.grid(row=1, column=0, sticky=W) # now add the frame to the GUI

Now rename main in the call to Button to GUIFrame, which assigns it to 
exist inside of the GUIFrame according to the GUIFrame's rows and columns.
